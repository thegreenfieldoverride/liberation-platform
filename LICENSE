## Liberation License Philosophy

This license embodies the principle that technology should serve human liberation, not human exploitation. 

**Why This License Exists:**

Traditional open source licenses (MIT, Apache, GPL) allow unlimited corporate use, often resulting in:
- Individual creators building tools that extract value from their own communities
- Corporate giants profiting from volunteer labor without reciprocity
- Technology being used to increase surveillance, manipulation, and oppression
- Open source becoming a pipeline for corporate extraction rather than human liberation

**The Liberation Alternative:**

The Liberation License creates technology commons that explicitly serve liberation while blocking exploitation. It recognizes that true freedom requires not just access to technology, but protection from its misuse.

**In Practice:**

- **Individual Users**: Full freedom to use, modify, and share
- **Community Projects**: Full freedom to build liberation tools
- **Cooperatives & Worker-Owned Orgs**: Welcome to use and contribute broadly
- **Humanitarian Organizations**: Encouraged to use for human welfare projects
- **Environmental Groups**: Welcome to use for ecological restoration
- **Educational Nonprofits**: Can use for liberation-focused learning
- **Profit-Driven Corporations**: Blocked from exploitation and rent-seeking
- **Surveillance Capitalists**: Cannot use for data extraction or manipulation
- **Financial Extractors**: Cannot use for wealth concentration systems
