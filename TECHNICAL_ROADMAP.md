## Medium-Term Opportunities (2-6 months)

### Custom Browser AI Infrastructure
**Goal**: Build sovereign AI infrastructure independent of Big Tech

**Technical Scope**:
- Custom WebAssembly runtime optimized for liberation planning models
- Native ONNX model loading with zero external dependencies
- Specialized quantization for privacy-focused AI models
- Integration with privacy-preserving model training

**Implementation Plan**:
1. **Weeks 1-2**: WASM runtime core with ONNX.js integration
2. **Weeks 3-4**: Model hub and caching system  
3. **Weeks 5-6**: WebGL/WebGPU acceleration backends
4. **Weeks 7-8**: Browser compatibility testing and optimization
5. **Weeks 9-10**: Documentation, examples, and open source release

**Value Proposition**:
- Zero dependency on external AI providers
- Optimized specifically for liberation planning use cases
- Valuable open source contribution to privacy-first AI
- Foundation for sovereign professional AI tools ecosystem

### Advanced Personalized AI System
**Goal**: Client-side vector database + contextual AI for deeply personalized liberation planning

**Technical Scope**:
- Browser-based vector database with IndexedDB persistence
- Local embedding generation for user context
- Semantic search across personal liberation journey
- Incremental learning from user interactions and outcomes

**Implementation Plan**:
1. **Week 1**: Minimal viable vector DB with hnswlib-wasm
2. **Week 2**: Local embedding pipeline with small transformer models
3. **Week 3**: IndexedDB persistence and data export/import
4. **Week 4**: Integration with liberation planning AI
5. **Week 5**: Contextual recommendations and pattern recognition
6. **Week 6**: User interface for context management and insights

**Privacy Architecture**:
- 100% client-side processing and storage
- Optional encrypted data export for backup
- No server-side user data collection
- User controls all data retention and deletion

### Liberation AI Ecosystem
**Goal**: Platform for sovereign professionals to share models and tools

**Components**:
- Federated model sharing (privacy-preserving)
- Community-contributed liberation planning models
- Industry-specific AI assistants (tech, design, writing, etc.)
- Peer-to-peer knowledge sharing without centralized servers

## Long-Term Vision (6+ months)

### Sovereign Professional AI Platform
- Decentralized network of privacy-first AI tools
- Industry-specific liberation models trained on community data
- Peer-to-peer model sharing and collaborative improvement
- Alternative to corporate AI ecosystem

### Technical Infrastructure
- Custom browser AI runtime as open source standard
- Privacy-preserving federated learning protocols
- Decentralized model hosting and distribution
- Integration with Web3/decentralized storage systems

## Key Technical Decisions

### AI Model Strategy
- **Current**: Transformers.js via CDN for speed
- **Medium-term**: Custom browser AI infrastructure for sovereignty  
- **Long-term**: Community-driven model ecosystem

### Personalization Approach
- **Phase 1**: Simple localStorage-based context
- **Phase 2**: Vector DB with semantic search
- **Phase 3**: Federated learning across sovereign professional network

### Privacy Architecture
- **Non-negotiable**: 100% client-side processing for personal data
- **Data sovereignty**: Users control all data export/import/deletion
- **Minimal telemetry**: Only anonymous usage statistics if user opts in
- **Transparency**: Open source all privacy-critical components

## Success Metrics

### Technical Metrics
- Model loading time < 30 seconds (cold start)
- AI inference time < 2 seconds per request
- Vector search performance < 100ms for 10K+ documents
- Browser compatibility across Chrome, Firefox, Safari

### User Experience Metrics  
- Liberation plan quality ratings from users
- Time from assessment to actionable plan
- User retention and engagement with AI features
- Community contributions to model improvement

### Impact Metrics
- Number of successful corporate escapes facilitated
- Open source adoption of browser AI infrastructure
- Growth of sovereign professional community
- Reduction in corporate AI dependency

## Resource Requirements

### Development Team
- **Core developer**: Full-stack with AI/ML experience (primary)
- **AI specialist**: Transformers, ONNX, browser optimization (consulting)
- **UX designer**: Privacy-focused user experience (part-time)
- **Community manager**: Open source ecosystem growth (part-time)

### Infrastructure
