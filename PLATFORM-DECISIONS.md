## üîÆ Technology Debt & Future Considerations

### **Current Technical Debt**
1. **No automated testing** - Need to add test suite
2. **Basic monitoring** - Could use more sophisticated observability
3. **Single region** - Need multi-region for global scale
4. **Manual scaling** - Could automate infrastructure scaling

### **Planned Investments**
| Investment | Estimated Cost | Estimated Time | Expected ROI |
|------------|----------------|----------------|--------------|
| **Test Suite** | $0 | 20 hours | Reduced bugs, faster development |
| **Advanced Monitoring** | $20/month | 10 hours | Better uptime, faster issue resolution |
| **Multi-Region** | $100/month | 30 hours | Global performance, redundancy |
| **Go API Backend** | $0 | 40 hours | User accounts, data sync, community features |

### **Technology Risks**
1. **Client-side limitations** - Some features may require server-side processing
2. **Browser compatibility** - IndexedDB/WebAssembly support
3. **Data export complexity** - Large datasets may be challenging
4. **Scaling operational overhead** - Manual server management at scale

### **Mitigation Strategies**
1. **Progressive enhancement** - Core features work without advanced browser features
2. **Graceful degradation** - Fallbacks for unsupported browsers
3. **Chunked exports** - Break large exports into manageable pieces
4. **Automation investment** - Build operational automation as we scale
