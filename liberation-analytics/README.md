# üî• Liberation Analytics

**Analytics for the liberation movement, not the surveillance state.**

Privacy-first analytics service built with Go, DuckDB, and radical transparency. Track the corporate exodus without becoming the thing you're escaping from.

## üéØ Liberation Philosophy

**We track the movement, not the individual.**

This isn't another surveillance capitalism tool dressed up as "analytics." Liberation Analytics measures collective patterns to accelerate the corporate exodus:

- **Which liberation tools actually work** - Real usage patterns, not marketing metrics
- **Geographic hotspots of escape** - Where the movement is strongest (country-level only)
- **Financial liberation patterns** - Aggregate data on runway calculations and real wage discoveries
- **Zero individual tracking** - Your personal data stays with you, period

**Built by escapees, for escapees.** üîì

## üö® Anti-Surveillance Manifesto

**Corporate analytics = digital colonialism.** Google Analytics, Facebook Pixel, Adobe Analytics - they're extraction engines designed to harvest human behavior for shareholder value.

**We reject this entirely.**

Liberation Analytics exists to:
- **Measure liberation, not exploitation** - Track collective escape patterns
- **Serve the movement, not shareholders** - Analytics that help people escape, not trap them
- **Privacy by architecture** - Cannot track individuals even if we wanted to
- **Radical transparency** - All source code open, all practices documented
- **Community controlled** - No VC funding, no corporate overlords

**If you're building tools to help people escape corporate imprisonment, this is your analytics platform.**

## üèó Architecture

**Universal Event Model:**
```json
{
  "app": "runway-calculator",
  "action": "calculate", 
  "attributes": {
    "runway_months": 8.5,
    "savings_band": "10k-25k",
    "industry": "tech"
  },
  "timestamp": "2025-01-23T21:45:00Z",
  "geo_hint": "US",
  "session_id": "sess_abc123"
}
```

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Server Setup
```bash
cd liberation-analytics
go run main.go
# Server starts on :8080
```

### Client Integration (JavaScript)
```html
<script src="/client.js"></script>
<script>
const analytics = new LiberationAnalytics('http://localhost:8080');

// Track events
analytics.trackRunwayCalculation(8.5, '10k-25k', '2k-4k', 'tech');
analytics.trackRealWageReveal('80k-100k', -23.5, 45, 'finance');
</script>
```

## üìä API Endpoints

### Event Tracking
```bash
POST /api/events
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "app": "runway-calculator",
  "action": "calculate",
  "attributes": {"runway_months": 8.5},
  "session_id": "sess_abc123"
}
```

### Insights (Aggregated Data Only)
```bash
# Usage patterns
GET /api/insights/usage

# Geographic liberation hotspots  
GET /api/insights/geographic

# Financial insights (aggregated)
GET /api/insights/financial

# Health check
GET /api/health
```

## üîí Privacy Guarantees

1. **No Individual Tracking** - Only aggregate patterns
2. **Minimal Data Collection** - Only what's needed for liberation insights
3. **Geographic Privacy** - Country-level only (e.g., "US", "CA")
4. **Session-Based** - Sessions reset, no persistent user IDs
5. **Self-Hosted** - Your data stays on your infrastructure

## üõ† Integration Examples

### Runway Calculator
```javascript
// When user calculates runway
analytics.trackRunwayCalculation(
  runwayMonths,    // 8.5
  savingsBand,     // "10k-25k" 
  expensesBand,    // "2k-4k"
  industry         // "tech"
);
```

### Real Hourly Wage Calculator
```javascript
// When user discovers real wage
analytics.trackRealWageReveal(
  salaryBand,      // "80k-100k"
  realWageDiff,    // -23.5 (percentage difference)
  commuteMinutes,  // 45
  industry         // "finance"
);
```

### Custom Events
```javascript
// For new liberation tools
analytics.track('custom-tool', 'action', {
  custom_attribute: 'value',
  measurement: 42
});
```
